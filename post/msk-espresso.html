<h3>Moscow's Best Espresso</h3>

<p><strong>Cooperative Cherniy</strong> is a small cooperative that four of Moscow&#8217;s liberal youth started just a few years ago, when they didn&#8217;t even have enough money for an espresso machine. Fast-forward six years later, however, and they&#8217;ve recently reopened in a grand new venue, while keeping the contacts to successfully brew Ethiopia Chelchele espresso, considered by many to be the best in town. Beware of the service though- for the few first times you go there, you&#8217;ll be looked up and down- until you can join their club.</p>

<p><strong>Coffeemania</strong>- the meeting place of well-to-do Muscovites. Their coffee in general is second to none- for example, the cream cappucino is the best I have ever had, not just in Moscow, but anywhere else. Because of that, the espresso is just agreeable, if the tiniest bit over roasted. Espresso-roasted beans can also be purchased</p>

<p><strong>DoubleB</strong> is, for many people who consider themselves coffee specialists, but are in reality just snobs, the best coffee chain. The roasts are always fruity, under-done and a little sour, and the service and interiors are on par with Moscow&#8217;s best. Also, it&#8217;s a big chain, so anywhere in the city you&#8217;re unlikely to be more than fifteen minutes away from their coffeeshop, and that&#8217;s quite convenient.</p>
