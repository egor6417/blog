<h3>Moscow's Best Espresso</h3>

<p><strong>Cooperative Cherniy</strong> is a small cooperative that four of Moscow&#8217;s liberal youth started just a few years ago, when they didn&#8217;t even have enough money for an espresso machine. Fast-forward six years later, however, and they&#8217;ve recently reopened in a grand new venue, while keeping the contacts to successfully brew Ethiopia Adado espresso, considered by many to be the best in town. Beware of the service though- for the few first times you go there, you&#8217;ll be looked up and down- until you can join their club.</p>

<p><strong>Coffeemania</strong> is the default meeting place of well-to-do Muscovites. Their coffee in general is second to none- for example, the cream cappucino is the best I have ever had, not just in Moscow, but anywhere else. Because of that, the espresso is just agreeable, if the tiniest bit over roasted. Espresso-roasted beans can also be purchased</p>

<p><strong>Espressium</strong> burst onto the Moscow coffee scene in the summer of 2017 with the goal of creating the perfect espresso in a traditionally drip-coffee-dominated city. They have indeed succeeded- their coffee is great, but unstable in quality. For their drip coffees, they use beans that are roasted in other countries, resulting in flavors that are unusual to see in Moscow.</p>
