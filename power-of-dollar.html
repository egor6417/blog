<h3>The Buying Power of the Dollar</h3>
<p>I was attracted to the world of economics and finance when I started digging into it to better understand blockchain technology. Eventually, economics became the prism through which I view the world.</p>

<p>This week, because of my explorative nature, I tried to compile a list of items that bring me joy, and their respective prices.</p>

<p>From the results in the list, one thing became obvious: after most basic needs are settled, nothing else comes even close in terms of pleasure/joy per dollar. For me personally, these &ldquo;basic needs&rdquo; are a single espresso and a few bananas for lunch.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s something to keep in mind when purchasing anything, even a small cup of coffee.</p>
