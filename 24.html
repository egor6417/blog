<h3 id="startups-in-12-months.">24 Startups in 12 Months.</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Egor Skorbenko, and I have challenged myself to create at least thirteen startups in the next twelve months. My stretch goal will be twenty-four.</p>
<p>In 2018, <strong>humankind has a problem- most ideas never see the light of day</strong>, due to reasons I will outline in the next paragraph. At the same time, however, too much of our time is wasted due to pacifiers, and those moments are ones we will never be able to get back.</p>
<p>My plan (or proposed solution) is simple. Most people, due to their nature, enjoy an abundance of ideas, but they never ship them, for various reasons: whether they are too self-doubting, or over-perfectionist or if they give up after 90% of the work is already finished. Therefore, <strong>my plan is to try out all of my ideas by shipping them.</strong></p>
<p>The definition of a startup that I will use for this experiment will be taken from Paul Graham and Pieter Levels, but slightly modified. </p>
<p> Paul Graham writes in his essay named Growth that &gt; &quot;a startup is a company designed to grow fast. Being newly founded does not in itself make a company a startup. Nor is it necessary for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or have some sort of &quot;exit.&quot; The only essential thing is growth. Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth.&quot; </p>
<p> Pieter Levels argues that &gt; &quot;a startup delivers a new product and grows it fast&quot;</p>
<p> Therefore, my idea could be said to be a startup if it ships a new product and experiences any sort of user growth.</p>
